# Java-Software-Solutions-9th-Edition-Projects
This repository contains the programming exercises in Java Software Solutions (9th) by Lewis and Loftus that were assigned to me in school.  This is not an official license, but you may use my code for educational purposes only and for checking against your own.  If you do copy any of the code, do so at your own risk.  I am not responsible if you get caught copying this.  I posted this as a backup resource, and for freedom of resources.
