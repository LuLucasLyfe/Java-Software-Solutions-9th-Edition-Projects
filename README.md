# Java-Software-Solutions-9th-Edition-Projects
This repository contains all the projects I was assigned at school, and includes some submitted by other people as well.
## Warning
This is not intended to be your primary resource for your projects, so don't just copy and paste code.  You can use this to check your code or use it to get ideas, but if you do choose to copy my work and others, I do not take any responsibility for your infringement.  Please take note not to copy anything from here, unless for your personal use, and nothing other.
## Submitting Code
Feel free to submit your code, but please include the project number and instructions.  Also name variables and classes accordingly, not "foo" or "bar".
