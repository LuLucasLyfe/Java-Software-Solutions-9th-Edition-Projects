# Java-Software-Solutions-9th-Edition-Projects
This repository contains all the projects I was assigned at school, and includes some submitted by other people as well.
## Warning
This is not intended to be your primary resource for your projects, so don't just copy and paste code.  You can use this to check your code or use it to get ideas, but if you do choose to copy my work and others, I do not take any responsibility for your infringement.  Please take note not to copy anything from here, unless for your personal use, and nothing other.
## Submitting Code
Submitting projects to this repository are fine, as long as you follow the basic rules below; I will change the formatting if any of it does not match how I format my code.  Check out my projects for the basic idea.  Please feel free to make any helpful changes to my code.
* Each project must include the code instructions at the top, following my format.  
* If there is only one class, name it according to its purpose not "project_1.1"
* Always include the driver classes, and place multiple classes in one folder with the project number (e.g. Project 4.4).
* Comment your code!  This resource is to help beginners and people who need pointers.
* Name variables and methods accordingly.  Yes, that means you can't name your variables 'foo' or 'bar'.
