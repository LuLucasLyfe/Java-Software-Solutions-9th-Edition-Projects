# Java-Software-Solutions-9th-Edition-Projects
This repository contains the programming exercises in Java Software Solutions (9th) by Lewis and Loftus that I was assigned at school.  Please note: you can copy this code at your own risk; I will not take responsibility if you choose to copy anything.  You can use this for reference to check your work, and may edit and test the code.
